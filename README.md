# Social-Images(Memes) Recognition and Classification Based on Convolutional Neural Network.

## Abstract

With the popularity of ‘Internet Social Culture’ in China, specific images that used to be made, generally with hilarious content, and spread rapidly in subcultures like post bars and other kinds of online forums, have also been gradually accepted and then appreciated by the masses. Furthermore, these ‘Social Function Pictures’ are called ‘memes’ today, and largely used in daily communication.

Most material of them come from capturing amusing moments of some characters in the film and television works or someone in our life, and further processing like secondary creations by fusing with linear hand-painted styles or adding subtitles will add new energy and put the soul into these ‘Social Function Pictures’.

The biggest difference between them and ‘emojis’, and other pictures is, these ‘Social Function Pictures’ are spontaneously produced by net friends, then spread via the Internet without external interventions. They carry exceedingly complicated information and connotation by simple static content, hold the sensory characteristics which text language doesn’t have. They can make our chat more three-dimensional, make users to be more accurately and conveniently when expressing their inner thoughts and real situations, and it is far easier for receivers to understand and feel the empathy.

The appearance of ‘Social Function Pictures’ perfectly meets the demand of the Internet era, so their content and scale have been exponentially increasing in recent years. An accompanying problem is, we usually need to pick out one or more suitable options from a large number of images with a given situation. However, these suitable options are not adjacent for most of the time, there will be a lot of distractions between them, for example images we saved from other apps.

Notwithstanding we can quickly comprehend and integrate extremely abstract content in enigmatic approaches that no single computer can truly compare, our limitations are also very obvious, it is totally impossible for most of us to exert calculation on the mass data by giving an appointed mathematical logic structure and formula, even if it is quite simple and we can assume that we will never feel tired and bored about this, subsequently come out the exact result set.

The more frequently we use ‘Social Function Pictures’ in our daily life, the eagerer are the needs for us to develop an agile and efficient method that can retrieve the deep-seated semantics of them by the subjective wants of people in specific situations.
